# Simple ADB Wrapper

Simle ADB Wrapper is an app for uninstalling apps from android smartphones. It's just an UI that wraps android platform-tools that I've write for myself.

## Installation

You can just clone git repo and execute below commands:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
Also you can use pyinstaller to package the app to *.exe file or to something else.
